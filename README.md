Data Analysis using Spotify Dataset, SQL and OOP

For my end of trimester project for module: Data Programming with R. The project was separated into 3 parts: Analysis, Packages and Programming. For analysis I carried out a statistical analysis on Spotify data. The packages part I was instructed to find a package in R and show some of its functionalities, I picked the DBI package which allowed me to interact with my SQL database on my local machine. I pulled and manipulated data from R. The final part was to explore OOP by creating a plot and a summary program with classes.

I have attached the project, a HTML of the project and the data I used,
